### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Mariela and I am a cartographer :earth_americas: turned into a fullstack developer :dragon_face:.

I was lucky enough to win one of the scholarships Globant was awarding through the "Code your future" program. Thanks to this I discovered the wonderful world of programming and its infinite possibilities.

I am currently deepening my studies in Javascript and Node to be able to carry out the 3rd and last project related to this course (online ordering system for a restaurant) and this is just the beginning. Stay tuned to see more! :rocket:

You can find me in LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariela-soledad-toledo/
